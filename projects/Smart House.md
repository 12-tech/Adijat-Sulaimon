This project involved designing and implementing a Java-based simulation of a Smart House system that efficiently manages both energy supply and consumption in real-time. The system was built to reflect real-world scenarios, combining smart devices, renewable energy sources, and intelligent control logic.

### Core Components:

- **Smart Device Simulation**  
  Lights, TVs, switches, and heaters were modeled as controllable devices with real-time energy consumption behavior.

- **Energy Sources**  
  Solar panels, battery storage, and grid electricity were simulated to provide dynamic energy availability based on supply conditions.

- **Energy Management System**  
  The central controller monitored supply and demand, distributing power intelligently across devices to optimize overall usage.

- **User Interface**  
  A console-based interface allowed users to control devices and monitor system status in real time.

- **System Logging**  
  All system actions and states were logged to both the console and external files for analysis and debugging.

### Key Features:

✅ **Device Control**  
Users could turn devices ON or OFF through the console interface while monitoring real-time energy consumption at both the device and system levels.

✅ **Energy Management**  
The system tracked battery levels, simulated solar energy generation, and dynamically allocated energy based on current demand and availability.

✅ **Concurrency Support**  
Java multithreading was leveraged to handle simultaneous device activity and background energy updates, creating a realistic and responsive simulation.

✅ **Logging**  
All actions, state changes, and energy flows were logged both to the console and to persistent log files, enabling transparency and traceability.

✅ **Unit Testing**  
Comprehensive unit tests were implemented to ensure stable operation, verify logic correctness, and handle exceptions robustly across all modules.
