Project X was a group project focused on the design and development of an amphibious rescue robot capable of assisting in real-world emergency situations, such as burning buildings and water rescues.

Our robot was engineered to navigate complex environments both on land and in water, equipped with a buoy system for supporting victims and a window-breaking tool designed to create alternative escape routes for trapped individuals.

As part of the development process, my team completed detailed requirements documentation and created the full 3D mechanical design using SolidWorks. Once the design phase was finalized, the components were fabricated using 3D printing for rapid prototyping and testing.

For autonomous navigation, the robot used the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to calculate efficient paths in unpredictable environments â€” ensuring reliable route discovery during search and rescue operations.

This project gave me hands-on experience with embedded systems, object-oriented programming, and real-world design constraints in rescue robotics. I was responsible for the mechanical design using SolidWorks and actively contributed to the development and testing of the navigation algorithms.
